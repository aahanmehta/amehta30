K28 -- Getting more comfortable with the dev console and the DOM
2023-04-19

===================================================================
DISCO:
-When you first load up an html file, it runs the JavaScript at the
beginning
-an anonymous function can be used to make other functions arguments
-you can edit html by accessing it as a list of tags in js.

QCC:
-If the html already has a tag, how do we edit its format?
-why do the blue stripes linger after we call red, shouldn't each item 
turn red because the loop starts from index 0?
