DISCO:
-read also reads in newline characters
-Split works well if you have a pattern in a str you want to sort
-to make something a tuple, you can either do it literally using parens,
or you can cast it using tuple(<object>)
QCC:
We learned about the use of using .close() because it protects you from
potential corruption.

OPS SUMMARY:
    make_dict(filename): reads the file, splitting into unformatted devos
    into a dictionary. Then a for loop splits each period into its own key
    if it doesn't exist already, and appends tuples of devo and ducky
    to that period, and returns the dictionary.
    
    get_rand_krewe(nums):
    1. Check if dictionary is empty
    2. Pick a random key after making a list of the keys in dictionary
    3. Checks if there aren't any elements in key
    4. Pick random element from dictionary in subsection key, using random.choice()
    5. Returns a list with both krewe member and period
