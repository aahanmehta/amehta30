QCC:
- Retrieves an HTML5 canvas element with an id of "slate".

- Instantiates a 2D canvas rendering context object for drawing graphics 
on the canvas.

- Defines two functions, drawRect and drawCircle, which draw a rectangle 
and a circle, respectively, on the canvas when the canvas is clicked.

- Defines a toggleMode function that switches between drawing rectangles 
and circles when called.

- Adds an event listener to the canvas that calls the draw function when 
the canvas is clicked.

and circle modes and one that clears the canvas.

- clientX refers to the horizontal coordinate of the mouse pointer 
relative to the viewport, which is the visible portion of the webpage. 
It is measured in pixels from the left edge of the viewport.

- offsetX, on the other hand, refers to the horizontal coordinate of the 
mouse pointer relative to the target element. It is measured in pixels 
from the left edge of the target element.
